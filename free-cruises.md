## General information

## Personal experience

Even though getting a "Wyndham Rewards Earner Card" gives more benefits like free $100 dinner at Caesars, complimentary stays in Dubai and Bahamas, it requires getting a credit card with an annual fee, so it's not completely free. I personally went the other route:

1. I googled a 3 months "free trial of the FoundersCard" (not a credit card)
2. The next day I went to https://founderscard.com/pages/cancel and tried canceling the card, it offered me free 3 months of full membership
3. Set a reminder to cancel the membership before 3 months run out to not be charged
4. One of the benefits of the full membership is the "Complimentary Diamond Caesars Rewards Status" (it takes ~2 weeks to get it)
5. Caesars Diamond status allows getting free cruises from:
    * Holland America: https://oceanplayersclub.com/hollandamericamatch/
    * Princess: https://oceanplayersclub.com/princessmatch/
    * Carnival: https://www.carnival.com/Registration/Promotions/casino-funmatch-altoxpatz
6. If you're willing to visit Atlantic City there is also an MSC cruise that comes with the Ocean Prime membership (more details in the article above)
