## Personal experience

Even though getting a "Wyndham Rewards Earner Card" gives more benefits like a free $100 dinner at Caesars and complimentary stays in Dubai and Bahamas, it requires getting a credit card with an annual fee, so it's not completely free. I went the other route:

1. Google a 3-month "free trial of the FoundersCard" (not a credit card). For example, here is one such [search results](https://founderscard.com/invite?code=VIP1SHAWN593).
2. The next day, go to https://founderscard.com/pages/cancel and attempt canceling the membership, it should offer you free 3 months of full membership.
3. Set a reminder to cancel the membership before 3 months run out to not be charged.
4. Create a [Caesars Rewards](https://www.caesars.com/a/security/register.aspx) account.
5. One of the benefits of the full membership is the "[Complimentary Diamond Caesars](https://founderscard.com/benefits/caesars-total-rewards)" status, request the benefit (provide the Caesars Rewards account number that was created at step 4). It takes ~2 weeks to receive it.
6. Caesars Diamond status allows getting free cruises from the following websites. (You will have to upload a screenshot that proves that you have Caesars Diamond status. You can see an example in the article above):
    * Holland America: https://oceanplayersclub.com/hollandamericamatch/
    * Princess: https://princess.medallionclassmarket.com/casinooffer
    * Carnival: https://www.carnival.com/Registration/Promotions/casino-funmatch
7. (Optional) Visit Atlantic City to get an MSC cruise (and more perks) that comes with the Ocean Prime membership (more details in the article above).
